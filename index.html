   <!-- Notes -->
   <p>Notes before checking this "catalogue" out :</p>
   
   <ol>
    <li><em>Every file made by me is for sure CC BY 4.0</em></li>
    <li><em>Be sure to go to your chosen file to copy the correct attributions</em></li>
    <li><em>Each video/picture you see has a thumbnail and that thumbnail has been scaled down to 360p to speed up loading times hence why I'm using full HTML, So the video/picture resolution is in fact not the same, the real resolution should be in its downloads name OR maybe the title.</em></li>
    <li><em>All of the file downloads are hosted personally even if they aren't under my username (If I made them, otherwise I will definitely point you to the appropriate download :D)</em></li>
    <li><em>All of these files are handpicked and usable with attribution, if you don't want to attribute me email me at <a href="mailto:ayitsmephoenix@airmail.cc">here</a> and you can use it without attributing me (i want to get your email so I can see what you're working on, tho if you don't wanna bother and just use it without attributing me AND without sending an email I don't think you have morals and if so go for it).</em></li>
    <li><em>You are a legend &hearts;</em></li>
   </ol>
   <p>Contact me! : <a href="mailto:ayitsmephoenix@airmail.cc">ayitsmephoenix@airmail.cc</a></p>
   <p>Thank you if you read it and if you didn't it was mostly some disclaimers and terms for using without attribution so not much, ENJOY!</p>
